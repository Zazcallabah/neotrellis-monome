# openscad and svg paths for the layers

mostly directly converted from dxf files posted in the discord, then massaged until openscad would accept them.

when importing svg files, openscad only considers closed paths, and doesnt do holes. So there are two files for each layer, one with the solid, and another with the holes to cut in the solid.
